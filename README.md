# DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF ALGORITHMS
Julian Caracotsios

This folder contains files for the homework assignments for the first half of the Coursera class "Algorithms
Design and Analysis," taught by Stanford professor Tim Roughgarden. I am currently working through the second half of
the course.

There are six weekly assignments, each of which has you implement a different algorithm to solve some problem, then
submit your results to Coursera for grading. The assignments are as follows:
    - Week 1: Calculate the number of inversions in a list of integers (i.e. the number of pairs i, j such that i comes
              before j, but i > j)
    - Week 2: Implement the QuickSort algorithm to sort an array of integers and analyze running time
    - Week 3: Implement Karger's algorithm to compute the minimum cut of an undirected graph
    - Week 4: Implement Kosaraju's algorithm to compute the strongly connected components of a directed graph
    - Week 5: Implement Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate shortest-path distances in a directed acyclic graph
    - Week 6: Use the heap data structure to solve the "median maintenance" problem and use hash tables to solve the
              "2-sum" problem

Each weekly assignment is in a subfolder, with full problem descriptions found in their corresponding Python scripts. Note that I did not include the data files as they can get rather large, but I am happy to include them later if desired.
